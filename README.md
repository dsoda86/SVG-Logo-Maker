# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This app is designed to make simple logos by answering a few prompt questions. The user answers the questions with their preference of shape (circle, triangle, square), text (up to 3 characters) and color for shape and text respetively. The app then generates a logo in an svg file with those preferences. Aside from the actual logo creation, the app uses Jest for testing, which was new. The implementaion of writing a test before the code was difficult and involved a lot of troubleshooting even after the main creation code was finished. I had trouble with type errors and invalid shape errors due to my prompt not having the correct typing and general import/export issues. I did learn a lot from this challenge and there is much that can be added to make this application quite useful in the future.
